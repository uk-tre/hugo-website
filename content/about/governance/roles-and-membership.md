# Roles and Membership

This document describes the different roles and responsibilities within the community.

## Member

Anyone is able to join the community by signing up for our [mailing list](https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/wa-jisc.exe?SUBED1=UK-TRE-COMM&A=1).

All members commit to abide by our:
- [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/uk-tre/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
- [Community Principles]({{< relref "./newcastle-commitment" >}})

When you sign up for the mailing list, you will be contacted by a member of the [Community Management Working Group]({{< relref "../../groups/current/community_management" >}}) via email with the above documents. 
Additionally anyone will be able to request to be sent these documents via a form on the website.

By joining the mailing list, you are agreeing to these documents. 
If you explicitly do not want to agree to these documents you can alert a member of the [Steering Group]({{< relref "./steering-group" >}}) with your decision. 
Subscribers of the mailing list that do not agree to these documents may remain subscribers and take part in all community events, but they will not be able to take part in community decisions.

You will also be given the option to be added to a public list of our participating members on our [website]({{< relref "../people" >}}) - this is optional and up to you, though we’d love to add you to show how big our community is!

To leave the community, you can simply unsubscribe from the mailing list. If you would like any additional action to be taken (for instance, having your name removed from the website), get in touch at [uktrecommunity@gmail.com](mailto:uktrecommunity@gmail.com) 

## Affiliated Organisation

We’re always looking for organisations to be officially associated with the community!

To become an affiliated organisation, please reach out to a member of the [Steering Group]({{< relref "./steering-group" >}}) or email us at [uktrecommunity@gmail.com](mailto:uktrecommunity@gmail.com).

We ask affiliated organisations to agree to:
- Abide by our [Code of Conduct]((https://github.com/uk-tre/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md))
- Abide by our [Community Principles]({{< relref "./newcastle-commitment" >}})
- Send at least one representative to each of our [quarterly community meetings]({{< relref "./events-management" >}})
- Have at least one representative participate in at least one [Working Group]({{< relref "../../groups/" >}})

Affiliated organisations will be displayed on our [website](/), and invited to run sessions at our [quarterly community meetings]({{< relref "./events-management" >}}).

Affiliated organisations can remove their affiliation upon written request to any member of the [Steering Group]({{< relref "./steering-group" >}}) or via email at [uktrecommunity@gmail.com](mailto:uktrecommunity@gmail.com).
