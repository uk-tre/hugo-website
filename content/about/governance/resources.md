# Resource management

We expect a lot of resources within the community to be created through [Working Groups]({{< relref "../../groups/" >}}). 

However, we are aware that many members and teams may create resources outside of formally defined working groups, which may be of benefit for the community.

If you have a resource you would like to submit to the [resource hub]({{< relref "../../community_resources/" >}}), please follow the [Working Group outputs process]({{< relref "./working-groups" >}}).
