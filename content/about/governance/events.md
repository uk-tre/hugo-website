# Events management

## Overview

There are three main categories of event within the  community:

- **Official UK TRE Community Events**: These are events being put on by the [Community Management Working Group]({{< relref "../../groups/current/community_management" >}}), and include all quarterly meetings, [Community Management Working Group]({{< relref "../../groups/current/community_management" >}}) meetings, Town Halls and any additional ad hoc community events.
- **Working group events**: These are events being run by [Working Groups]({{< relref "../../groups/" >}}). They include their regular open meetings, as well as any ad hoc events they put on.
- **Other TRE events**: These are any other events we are aware of within the TRE landscape that we signpost people towards.

Events calendar

We have an events calendar set up in TeamUp. This is available on our [events page]({{< relref "../../events" >}}).

This is a comprehensive calendar containing all events we are aware of within the TRE Community, along with instructions on how to subscribe.

If you’d like to add an event to this calendar, please read through the process in ‘Other TRE Events’ below.

## Official UK TRE Community Events

### Quarterly meetings

Our quarterly meetings take place in March, June, September, and December.

Currently March, June and December are fully online, half-day meetings. 
Our September meeting is a full day hybrid event based at a location within the UK.

All meetings are free to attend, and anyone can sign up!

#### Meeting structure

The quarterly meetings follow broadly the same structure, with an additional session at the September meetings:

##### Keynote

The meetings start with a keynote session followed by an elongated Q&A.

The keynote is decided by, and invited by, the [Community Management Working Group]({{< relref "../../groups/current/community_management" >}}), with input from the community.

##### Community updates (online meetings) / Lightning Talks (hybrid meeting)

In online meetings, there is a window where any members of the community can share informal, quick updates on work they are doing, outputs, initiatives and more.

All active [Working Groups]({{< relref "../../groups/" >}}) are required to give an update during community updates.

At the all-day hybrid meeting, instead of informal community updates there is a full session of lightning talks. 
Teams or individuals have 5 minutes to present their work to the rest of the community, with a focus on calls to action and ways to collaborate.

All active [Working Groups]({{< relref "../../groups/" >}}) are required to give an update during lightning talks.

##### Breakout sessions

Breakout sessions are opportunities for attendees to join smaller groups and work on a particular problem. 
There are two main types of breakout sessions:
- **Workshops**: These are planned sessions, where a member/team can bring an issue they are currently working on to the community to brainstorm possible solutions with other members of the community.
- **Discussions**: These are more informal sessions where members come together to openly discuss a particular topic within the TRE space.

#### Registering and suggesting sessions

All quarterly meetings are open invite and free to attend.

Registration for meetings are live one at a time. 
Links to register are live on our [website](/), as well as shared on our [mailing list](https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/wa-jisc.exe?SUBED1=UK-TRE-COMM&A=1) and [Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/uktrecommunity/shared_invite/zt-26r7jz25d-J5iV0XoqyLepEiKk4XpJVg).

When you register, you are prompted to share details on sessions you would like to run.

Further to this, members of the [Community Management Working Group]({{< relref "../../groups/current/community_management" >}}) may reach out to you to suggest sessions you could run at the meeting - these suggestions will be based on community interest and your expertise!

All suggested sessions are reviewed by the [Community Management Working Group]({{< relref "../../groups/current/community_management" >}}), who then decide the final agenda. 
This is communicated with everybody who suggested a session, and justification will be provided to anyone who has suggested a session that does not make it onto the final agenda.

If members are unsatisfied with any decision that is made about proposed sessions, they can reach out to the [Community Management Working Group]({{< relref "../../groups/current/community_management" >}}), and if required raise an [Objection]({{< relref "/consensus-review-objection" >}}).

Members who suggested a session that is added to the final agenda may be needed to provide additional information for the event.

## Working Group Events

All [Working Groups]({{< relref "../../groups/" >}}) are required to have one regular meeting which is open for anybody from the community to join. 
This will be advertised both on the [events calendar]({{< relref "../../events" >}}) and [Working Group page]({{< relref "../../groups/" >}}).

Additionally, [Working Groups]({{< relref "../../groups/" >}}) may wish to add ad hoc events to the calendar. 
To do so they can fill in the Event requests form (see below).

## Other TRE Events
Events that are not officially run by any working group can also be added to the calendar!

To do so, members must follow the below process.

### 1. Fill in the events request form
The form can be found here: https://forms.gle/2J6DG8TKWkbQmCFZ9

If your event already has a registration page, you can simply link to this page and submit.

If it doesn’t already have a registration page, you’ll need to provide details of your event in the next section.

### 2. Review

Responses will be reviewed by the [Community Management Working Group]({{< relref "../../groups/current/community_management" >}}). 

If approved, the event will be added to the [events calendar]({{< relref "../../events" >}}) and included in upcoming events announcements to the community.

If not approved, the [Community Management Working Group]({{< relref "../../groups/current/community_management" >}}) will provide reasons to the named member on the form. 
Members can then amend their form and resubmit, or if required, seek further clarification from the [Community Management Working Group]({{< relref "../../groups/current/community_management" >}}). 
If required, members can raise an [Objection]({{< relref "/consensus-review-objection" >}}).
