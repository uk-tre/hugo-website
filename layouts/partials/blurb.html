            <p>
                We want to have a <b>four nations, coordinated, collaborative approach</b> to research infrastructure for working with sensitive data.</br></br>
                As a community, we run community events, support working groups, and signpost to relevant resources and tools for the TRE community.</br></br>
                Whilst we are focused on the UK, we welcome anyone working on research infrastructure to work with us!
